# SQL Course Repository

This repository contains my work from the SQL course by [MoureDev](https://github.com/mouredev). Throughout the course, I'll be learning and applying various SQL concepts, and I will be regularly uploading my progress and the exercises I complete.

## About the Course

The SQL course by MoureDev is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of SQL, from basic queries to more advanced database management tasks. The course covers:

- SQL Basics: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Advanced Queries: JOINs, subqueries, and more
- Database Design: normalization, relationships, and keys
- Performance Optimization: indexes, query optimization
- Real-world Scenarios: solving complex database problems

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to different topics or sections of the course. Each directory may contain:

- **SQL scripts**: `.sql` files with the queries and commands I write during the course.
- **Notes**: Additional notes or markdown files explaining certain concepts or summarizing sections.
- **Projects/Exercises**: Practical projects or exercises that apply the concepts learned in each section.

## How to Use

You can browse through the directories to see my progress and the work I’ve done. If you want to run any SQL scripts, you can use your preferred SQL client or database management system. Ensure that the appropriate database and tables are set up according to the script requirements.

## Contributions

This is a personal learning repository, so I’m not accepting contributions at this time. However, feel free to fork the repository if you find any of the scripts or notes useful for your own learning journey.
